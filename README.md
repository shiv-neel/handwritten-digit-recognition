# Handwritten Digit Recognition AI

This project uses deep learning to categorize a pixelated hand-written digit between 0-9, hitting an upper bound of roughly 94% accuracy. It implements open source machine learning frameworks such as Tensorflow and Keras to create the model and train it efficiently. 

The data used in this project comes from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which put together thousands of pixelated 28x28 images of handwritten digits, with each pixel containing data on its individual activation, scaled 0-1. For instance, a pixel that the number contains would be closer to 1, whereas a pixel closer to the edges of the square would be closer to 0.

In the future, other activation functions and more hidden layers could be added to boost the model's prediction accuracy of handwritten digits.
