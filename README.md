# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project uses deep learning to categorize a pixelated hand-written digit between 0-9 with up to 98.2% accuracy. It implements open source machine learning modules such as Tensorflow and Keras to create the model and train it efficiently. 

The data used in this project comes from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database, which put together thousands of pixelated 28x28 images of handwritten digits, with each pixel containing data on its individual activation, scaled 0-1. For instance, a pixel that the number contains would be closer to 1, whereas a pixel closer to the edges of the square would be closer to 0.
